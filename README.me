# Gear Exporter and Viewer

## Overview

This project consists of two components: a PHP web application and a Lua addon for a game (likely World of Warcraft). The PHP application manages weapon and gem data, allowing users to view and share their gear builds. The Lua addon provides an interface within the game to export gear information in a CSV format.

## PHP Application

### Features

- **Database Connection**: Connects to a SQLite database (`weapons.db`) to store and retrieve weapon and gem data.
- **Build Management**: Fetches build data using a build ID from the URL, displaying gear and gem information.
- **CSV Parsing**: Parses CSV data input from users to update the database with weapon and gem details.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Retrieves weapon and gem details from the database and displays them in a user-friendly format using Bootstrap for styling.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling for database connections and queries.
- **Shareable Links**: Generates a link to share user builds.

### Key Functions

- **Database Connection**: Establishes a connection to the SQLite database and handles errors.
- **Fetch Build Data**: Retrieves build information based on the build ID provided in the URL.
- **CSV Parsing**: Processes CSV data to extract gear and gem information.
- **Fetch Gem Details**: Retrieves detailed information about gems based on their IDs.
- **Display Build**: Renders the build information in a structured format in the web interface.

### Usage

1. Upload the PHP files to a web server with PHP support.
2. Ensure the SQLite database (`weapons.db`) is properly set up with the necessary tables for weapons, gems, and builds.
3. Access the application via a web browser to view and manage gear builds.

## Lua Addon

### Features

- **User Interface**: Creates a frame within the game for users to view and export their gear information.
- **Export Gear**: Collects gear data from the player's inventory and formats it as a CSV string.
- **Popup Dialog**: Displays a popup with the CSV data and provides a link to a website for further actions.
- **Slash Command**: Implements a command (`/exportgear`) to trigger the gear export functionality.
- **Export Button**: Adds an "Export Gear" button to the character frame for easy access to the export feature.

### Key Functions

- **CreateFrame**: Sets up the main frame and UI components for the gear exporter.
- **GetGearInfo**: Collects gear information from the player's inventory, including item IDs, names, enchantments, and gem IDs.
- **ShowGearExporterPopup**: Displays the gear data in a text box for easy copying.
- **Slash Command**: Allows users to export their gear information via a simple command.
- **AddExportButton**: Integrates an export button into the character frame for quick access.

### Usage

1. Install the Lua addon in your World of Warcraft interface folder.
2. Use the `/exportgear` command in-game to export your gear data.
3. Alternatively, click the "Export Gear" button in the character frame to view and copy your gear information.

## Conclusion

This project combines a web application and a game addon to enhance the user experience for managing and sharing gear builds. The PHP application serves as a backend to store and display data, while the Lua addon offers an in-game interface for easy gear exporting.
